Secure Database Management System (SDMS): A project that shows how to safely store and manage private information in a database. It uses strong protection methods like data encryption (locking sensitive data), user permissions (only certain people can see or change data), and activity logs (records of who did what). It’s built to keep information safe and prevent hacking or mistakes when people enter data.
